# Project 2: ECG Signal Analysis and Heart Rate Visualization

## Overview
This project analyzes ECG signals and visualizes corresponding heart rate data using Python. It demonstrates key biomedical signal processing concepts and provides insights into heart activity.

## Objectives
- Extract and analyze ECG features:
  - P wave, QRS complex, and T wave durations and amplitudes.
  - PR, QT, and RR intervals.
  - Mean heart rate.
- Visualize ECG signals alongside heart rate over time.

## Tools Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Methodology
- The ECG data is filtered and analyzed for key features like wave durations and amplitudes.
- Visualizations are created to showcase the ECG signal and heart rate over specific time windows.

## Key Features
1. Custom function to extract features from ECG data.
2. Visualization of ECG signals and heart rate.
3. Calculation of important cardiac intervals (PR, QT, RR).

## Results
