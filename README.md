## 🧠 Overview

This project explores the **temporal and amplitude features** of ECG waveforms and visualizes both ECG signal data and estimated **heart rate trends** over time.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Extract and analyze key ECG waveform components:
  - P wave, QRS complex, and T wave durations and amplitudes  
  - PR, QT, and RR intervals  
  - Average heart rate (BPM)
- Visualize ECG signals and overlay heart rate measurements
- Demonstrate filtering and timing analysis in Python

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 3  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

---

## ✨ Key Features

1. ✅ Custom function to process ECG signal data
